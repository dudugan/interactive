        <h1>laughs</h1>
        <p>Human memories are primarily visual. We may smell dog piss and remember that awful
            decaf we had at Common Grounds, we may hear a specific song and remember singing along
            with friends, but in general... when we call up a memory intentionally - as much 
            that is even possible - what arises is an image. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We hoard images of each other. We are obsessed with the photo, the selfie, the memory.
            Even videos - we are obsessed with the illusion of life. 
            But rarely do we hoard each other's sound, or remember it. Can you remember the voice
            of your childhood friend? Can you remember their laugh?
            <br>
            <br>
            Laughs are iconic. Often when I hear my friends laugh, I think, “oh my god that laugh
            is SO this-person,” because laughs are, in my opinion, one of the most unique things
            about people. It's really hard to change the way you laugh - it's really hard to even
            <em>notice</em> the way you laugh - and so people's laughs are a kind of unrefined beauty.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is a shame that we don't remember them. 
            <br>
            <br>
            That's why I made this site - to remember :&rpar;
