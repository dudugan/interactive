        <h1>laughs</h1>
        <p>We are constantly taking visual recordings of each other. Photos, videos. Sometimes
            there is audio attached. We remember people's faces, people's
            personalities, maybe even people's voices. But rarely do we remember each other's laughs, unless forced to
            think about it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In my opinion, laughs are one of the most unique identifiers of individuality. 
            No two people laugh alike - but just like with people's faces and voices, it's
            often possible to see how someone's laugh developed. I have similar laughs to my
            father, and my uncle, and my grandfather, for example.

            When you capture a friend's laugh, you may think, “oh my god that is SO this-person.”
            That is the feeling I aim to preserve on this site. A collection of my friends laughs :&rpar;
